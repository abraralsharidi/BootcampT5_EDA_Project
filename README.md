#### Abstract
The objective of this project was to analyze metro station data in order to help the organization choose the best station where the largest number of people are located so that they can register the largest number of emails. I worked with the data provided by MTA and used EDA in Python to analyze the data. I displayed the busiest stations and used the libraries in Python to display them.

#### Design
This project originates from WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has a summer gala in New York City each year. And you need to know which stations have more people, as you take the largest number of emails addresses to fill the event space with people.
classifying statuses accurately via machine learning models would enable the (WTWY)
ttake action to improve operations.It will enable faster and more accurate identification of crowded stations, ensuring that the organization's team reaches the crowded stations and distributes them perfectly to take the addresses of as many people as possible.

#### Data
The dataset contains three mounths start from februir, march and April in 2021 year.. A few feature highlights include C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION, DATE , TIME and ENTRIES. The busiest station has been analyzed in detail.

#### Algorithm
• Highlight strong to entries values for each station that identified during EDA

#### Tools
• Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
• Matplotlib for plotting
• Tableau for interactive visualizations
